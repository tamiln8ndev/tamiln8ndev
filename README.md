## 🧠 My Journey So Far

After 10 years in the e-commerce industry, I shifted gears to focus on automation, self-hosted tools, and AI integration.  
In the past year, I’ve built a variety of useful bots, backend tools, and workflow systems from scratch — fully self-taught.

- Automation: n8n, Make.com, Telegram Bots, APIs  
- Backend: Docker, Ubuntu, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Certbot, rclone  
- AI: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Pollinations, Fal.ai, Hugging Face Spaces  
- E-commerce: Shopify, Magento, Laravel backend coordination  
- Reporting: Google Sheets + Power Query + Custom Dashboards

## 💡 Projects I've Built

- Text-to-Image Bot (Telegram + Pollinations API)  
- Weather Report Bot (Real-time Telegram + OpenWeatherMap)  
- Daily Journal Logger (Telegram → Google Sheets via n8n)  
- Full Automation Server (Hetzner VPS with scheduled backups, HTTPS, and secure bots)
