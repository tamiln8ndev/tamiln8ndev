## 🧠 My Journey So Far

After a decade in operations — leading logistics, customer service, and e-commerce management — I found a new passion: automation and AI.  

I’m all about making complex workflows simple and efficient, whether it’s moving stock in warehouses or building bots that generate AI art.  

From managing Lazada and Shopee stores to negotiating 3PL contracts and leading teams, I understand business needs deeply.  

Now, I combine that with my skills in tech — self-hosting servers, coding automation in n8n, and integrating AI tools — to create seamless systems that save time, cut costs, and boost growth.
