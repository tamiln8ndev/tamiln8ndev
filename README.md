From managing Lazada and Shopee stores to negotiating 3PL contracts and leading teams, I understand business needs deeply. Now, I combine that with my skills in tech — self-hosting servers, coding automation in n8n, and integrating AI tools — to create seamless systems that save time, cut costs, and boost growth.
